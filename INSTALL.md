# pg_wait_tracer — Installation Guide

## Supported Platforms

- **Linux kernel** >= 5.8, **or** EL8 (RHEL/Rocky/Alma/Oracle Linux 8.10,
  kernel 4.18 with backported BPF ring buffer + BTF). BTF is always required;
  on kernels without the BPF ring buffer the tool degrades to sampled-only.
- **Architecture**: x86_64, aarch64
- **PostgreSQL**: 17, 18 (full); 13 (supported — query attribution requires
  `pg_stat_statements`); 14–16 not yet (see Troubleshooting)
- **Tested on**: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Rocky Linux 9, AlmaLinux 9,
  Oracle Linux 9, RHEL 9, Rocky Linux 8.10 / AlmaLinux 8 / Oracle Linux 8 / RHEL 8

## Prerequisites

### 1. Build Dependencies

#### Rocky Linux 9 / RHEL 9 / AlmaLinux 9 / Oracle Linux 9

```bash
# Enable CRB (CodeReady Builder) repo — required for libbpf-devel
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb                        # Rocky/RHEL/AlmaLinux
# sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol9_codeready_builder    # Oracle Linux

# Core build tools (tar may be missing on minimal installs)
sudo dnf install -y gcc clang llvm make tar

# BPF toolchain (libbpf-devel requires CRB repo enabled above)
sudo dnf install -y bpftool libbpf-devel

# ELF and compression libraries
sudo dnf install -y elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel lz4-devel

# For DWARF-based st_query_id offset detection (optional, for query_event view)
sudo dnf install -y elfutils    # provides readelf
```

#### Rocky Linux 8 / RHEL 8 / AlmaLinux 8

RHEL 8 ships `libbpf` 0.5.0 and an old `bpftool`, which predate the USDT
support pg_wait_tracer needs. The Makefile detects this automatically and, on
EL8 only, builds a pinned `libbpf` + `bpftool` from source into `build/`
(requires network access at build time). EL9 and Ubuntu are unaffected.

```bash
# powertools is EL8's equivalent of EL9's CRB repo
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools

# Core build tools + BPF toolchain + ELF/compression libs.
# (git is required: the Makefile clones pinned libbpf/bpftool on EL8.)
sudo dnf install -y gcc clang llvm make tar git \
    elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel lz4-devel bpftool libbpf-devel
```

PGDG packages a **non-PIE** postgres binary on EL8 (PIE on EL9); pg_wait_tracer
handles both. The kernel must still expose BTF (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`) —
present by default on Rocky 8.10 / RHEL 8.

#### Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 / Debian 12

```bash
# Core build tools
sudo apt install -y gcc clang llvm make

# BPF toolchain
sudo apt install -y linux-tools-common linux-tools-$(uname -r) libbpf-dev

# ELF and compression libraries
sudo apt install -y libelf-dev zlib1g-dev liblz4-dev

# For DWARF-based st_query_id offset detection (optional)
sudo apt install -y binutils    # provides readelf
```

### 2. Kernel BTF Support

The kernel must expose BTF (BPF Type Format) data. Verify:

```bash
ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
```

If missing, install the BTF-enabled kernel:
- **Rocky Linux 9 / RHEL 9 / AlmaLinux 9**: Enabled by default
- **Oracle Linux 9**: `sudo dnf install -y kernel-uek` (UEK7+ has BTF)
- **Ubuntu**: Enabled by default on 22.04+

### 3. PostgreSQL

#### Rocky Linux 9 / RHEL 9 / Oracle Linux 9

```bash
# Install PGDG repository
sudo dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

# Install PostgreSQL 17 (or 18)
sudo dnf install -y postgresql17-server postgresql17-contrib

# Initialize and start
sudo /usr/pgsql-17/bin/postgresql-17-setup initdb
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql-17

# (Optional) Debug symbols for query_event view, query text capture, plan_id
sudo dnf install -y postgresql17-debuginfo
```

##### PostgreSQL 13 (EOL — use the PGDG archive repo)

PostgreSQL 13 is end-of-life and has been removed from the live PGDG repo,
so `postgresql13-server` will not install from `pgdg-redhat-repo-latest`.
Add the PGDG **archive** repo instead (adjust `rhel-9` → `rhel-8` for EL8):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/pgdg13-archive.repo >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[pgdg13-archive]
name=PostgreSQL 13 (PGDG archive)
baseurl=https://yum-archive.postgresql.org/13/redhat/rhel-9-x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

sudo dnf install -y postgresql13-server postgresql13-contrib
sudo /usr/pgsql-13/bin/postgresql-13-setup initdb
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql-13
```

PG13 has no in-core query id, so the **query_event view requires
`pg_stat_statements`** — add it to `shared_preload_libraries` and restart:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries='pg_stat_statements'"
sudo systemctl restart postgresql-13
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements"
```

Wait capture itself works without it. (No PG13 debuginfo exists anymore;
the tracer uses header-derived offsets, so debuginfo is not required.)

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL 17 (or 18)
sudo apt install -y postgresql-17 postgresql-contrib-17

# (Optional) Debug symbols for query_event view, query text capture, plan_id
sudo apt install -y postgresql-17-dbgsym
```

### 4. Test Dependencies (optional)

Running the full test suite requires additional packages and PostgreSQL configuration.

#### Packages

```bash
# Rocky/RHEL/Oracle Linux 9:
sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip bc

# Ubuntu:
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip bc

# pgbench is included in postgresql-contrib (already installed above)

# Web UI tests (optional — skipped if not installed)
pip3 install playwright websockets
playwright install chromium

# On Rocky/RHEL, Chromium also needs:
sudo dnf install -y atk at-spi2-atk cups-libs libXcomposite libXdamage \
    libXrandr libgbm pango alsa-lib nss libxkbcommon
```

#### PostgreSQL Configuration

Tests connect as `postgres` user via `psql` and `pgbench`. On a fresh install
running tests as root, you need to allow local connections without a password:

```bash
# Find pg_hba.conf and switch local auth from peer to trust (test use only)
# Rocky/RHEL: /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/pg_hba.conf
# Ubuntu:     /etc/postgresql/17/main/pg_hba.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^local\s\+all\s\+all\s\+peer/local   all             all                                     trust/' \
    /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/pg_hba.conf    # adjust path for your OS/version
sudo systemctl reload postgresql-17
```

Enable extensions and settings used by tests:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET compute_query_id = 'on'"
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4"
sudo systemctl restart postgresql-17
```

Initialize pgbench:

```bash
pgbench -U postgres -i postgres    # any scale works; -s 50 for more realistic IO
```

#### Optional: pg_wait_sampling (for cross-validation tests)

The `test_cross_pg_wait_sampling` and Extension event tests require pg_wait_sampling.
These tests are **gracefully skipped** if the extension is not installed.

```bash
# Rocky/RHEL/Oracle Linux 9 (PG17 example):
sudo dnf install -y pg_wait_sampling_17

# Ubuntu (PG17 example):
sudo apt install -y postgresql-17-pg-wait-sampling
```

Add to shared_preload_libraries and restart:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, pg_wait_sampling'"
sudo systemctl restart postgresql-17
```

### 5. Go Toolchain (for the web investigation client)

The web investigation client (`pgwt`) is written in Go. Install Go >= 1.21
if you want to build it. This runs on your **laptop** (macOS or Linux), not
the DB server.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install go

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install -y golang-go

# Rocky / RHEL / Fedora
sudo dnf install -y golang

# Or download from https://go.dev/dl/
```


## Build

### Daemon + Server (C) — runs on DB server

```bash
cd pg_wait_tracer
make clean
make
```

This produces two binaries in the project root:
- `pg_wait_tracer` — the BPF daemon (requires BPF toolchain, root)
- `pgwt-server` — the trace file server (no BPF dependencies)

To build only `pgwt-server` (e.g. on a machine without BPF toolchain):

```bash
make pgwt-server
```

Build steps performed automatically:
1. Generate `vmlinux.h` from kernel BTF via `bpftool`
2. Compile BPF program with `clang`
3. Generate BPF skeleton header via `bpftool gen skeleton`
4. Compile and link userspace C code with `gcc`

### Trace File Server (C) — runs on DB server

```bash
cd pg_wait_tracer
make pgwt-server
```

This produces the `pgwt-server` binary. It reads trace files and serves
aggregated data over stdin/stdout (JSON lines protocol). No BPF dependencies —
only requires `liblz4` and `zlib` at runtime.

Copy it to the DB server:

```bash
scp pgwt-server root@db-server:/usr/local/bin/
```

Or build directly on the DB server (no BPF toolchain needed):

```bash
# Only needs: gcc, make, lz4-devel, zlib-devel
make pgwt-server
```

### Web Investigation Client (Go) — runs on your laptop

```bash
cd web
go mod tidy    # downloads dependencies, generates go.sum
go build -o pgwt .
```

This produces the `pgwt` binary. Run it from your laptop:

```bash
# Connects to DB server over SSH, opens browser at localhost:8384
./pgwt root@db-server

# Custom trace directory
./pgwt --trace-dir /var/lib/pgwt/traces root@db-server

# Custom pgwt-server path on remote host
./pgwt --server-path /usr/local/bin/pgwt-server root@db-server
```

**Requirements:**

- Go >= 1.21 on your laptop (build time only — the binary is self-contained)
- SSH access to the DB server (uses your default SSH key)
- `pgwt-server` binary on the DB server (either in PATH or specified with
  `--server-path`)
- Trace files on the DB server (produced by `pg_wait_tracer --daemon -T <dir>`)
- SSH user must be in the trace file group (default `dba`) — see below

**Setting up trace file access for non-root users:**

The daemon runs as root but creates trace files readable by a configurable Unix
group (default: `dba`). SSH users connecting via `pgwt` need to be in this group:

```bash
# Create the group (once)
sudo groupadd dba

# Add your SSH user to the group
sudo usermod -aG dba youruser

# The user must log out and back in for the group change to take effect
```

The daemon sets permissions automatically:
- Trace directory: `0750` (`rwxr-x---`), owned by `root:dba`
- Trace files: `0640` (`rw-r-----`), owned by `root:dba`

To use a different group name:
```bash
sudo ./pg_wait_tracer --daemon -T /var/lib/pgwt/traces --trace-group mygroup
```

### Text Dump (pgwt-server --dump)

```bash
# Quick summary of trace files (no root needed)
pgwt-server --dump /var/lib/pgwt/traces
```

## Quick Test

```bash
# Must run as root. The default capture tier is "tiered" (low-overhead
# always-on sampler with on-demand escalation).
sudo ./pg_wait_tracer --pid $(pgrep -xo postgres) --interval 5 --duration 10 -v

# To exercise the exact hardware-watchpoint tier (requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN),
# force it with --mode full:
sudo ./pg_wait_tracer --mode full --pid $(pgrep -xo postgres) \
    --interval 5 --duration 10 -v
```

## Run Tests

```bash
# Build and run all tests (requires root + running PostgreSQL)
sudo tests/run_all.sh

# Target a specific PG version on multi-instance hosts
sudo tests/run_all.sh --pg-version 18

# Or specify the postmaster PID directly
sudo tests/run_all.sh --pid 12345

# Individual test layers:
make -C tests                             # Build C tests + generators
tests/test_wait_event                     # C unit: event ID parsing (75 checks)
tests/test_cmdline                        # C unit: CLI parser (36 checks)
tests/test_bucket                         # C unit: histogram buckets (25 checks)
python3 tests/test_data_time_model.py     # Synthetic: time model math
python3 tests/test_data_transitions.py    # Synthetic: transition matrix
python3 tests/test_data_lock_chains.py    # Synthetic: lock chains + interference
python3 tests/test_web_ui.py              # Playwright: 108 browser checks
make bench                                # Performance: 10.8M events/sec

# Memory safety checks:
make test-asan                            # Rebuild with AddressSanitizer
make test-valgrind                        # Run under Valgrind
```

## Troubleshooting

### "symbol 'my_wait_event_info' not found"

The postgres binary must export the `my_wait_event_info` symbol. Verify:

```bash
# Check dynamic symbol table (works even on stripped binaries)
readelf -s --dyn-syms /usr/pgsql-17/bin/postgres | grep my_wait_event_info

# Or via nm (requires non-stripped binary)
nm /usr/pgsql-17/bin/postgres | grep my_wait_event_info
```

PGDG-packaged binaries are typically stripped but retain dynamic symbols (`readelf`
will find them). If neither works, you may need a postgres build that preserves
the symbol table.

### "st_query_id offset not found"

The `query_event` view requires knowing the offset of `st_query_id` in
`PgBackendStatus`. Three detection methods are tried automatically:

1. **DWARF debug symbols** (preferred) — install `postgresql-XX-dbgsym` or
   `postgresql-XX-debuginfo`
2. **Known offset table** — built-in for PG17/18 on x86_64 (offset=424)
3. **Disabled** — other views (time_model, system_event, session_event, histogram)
   still work

The same DWARF-based discovery is used for `st_activity` (query text capture)
and `st_plan_id` (plan identifier, PG18+ only). Installing debug symbols
enables all three features.

### Plan identifier (st_plan_id) shows 0

PostgreSQL 18 added `st_plan_id` to `PgBackendStatus`, but core PG does not
compute it automatically. You need a `planner_hook` extension:

- **pg_store_plans** — stores actual plan text indexed by (queryid, planid)
- **pg_stat_sql_plans** — computes plan hash and stores plan-level stats

Without such an extension, `st_plan_id` remains 0 and the feature is silently
inactive. On PG17 and earlier, `st_plan_id` does not exist.

### "Cannot find load base" or "/proc permission denied"

Ensure running as root (`sudo`) or with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` + `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`.

### "bpftool: command not found"

```bash
# Rocky / RHEL / Oracle Linux:
sudo dnf install -y bpftool

# Ubuntu (bpftool is in linux-tools):
sudo apt install -y linux-tools-$(uname -r)
```

### Kernel BTF missing (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` not found)

The kernel must be compiled with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`. Rocky Linux 9,
RHEL 9, Oracle Linux UEK7+, and Ubuntu 22.04+ have this by default. Older
kernels may need an upgrade.

### PostgreSQL version compatibility

pg_wait_tracer observes each backend's `wait_event_info` field. How it reaches
that field depends on the PostgreSQL major version:

- **PG17, PG18 — full.** PostgreSQL writes wait events through the
  `my_wait_event_info` global pointer; the tracer resolves it directly. Wait
  event names are also discovered dynamically from `pg_wait_events` (PG17+).
- **PG13 — supported.** PostgreSQL 13 writes directly to
  `MyProc->wait_event_info`; the tracer resolves `MyProc` and adds the known
  PGPROC offset (684, verified live on 13.23), with a runtime validation guard
  that refuses to attach if the offset looks wrong. Both tiers (sampled and
  full) use this path. PG13 has no in-core query id, so the **query_event view
  requires `pg_stat_statements`** in `shared_preload_libraries` — without it,
  query views report unavailable (or the daemon exits if `--view query_event`
  was explicitly requested), but wait capture is unaffected.
- **PG14, PG15, PG16 — not yet.** These also write to
  `MyProc->wait_event_info`, but their verified PGPROC offsets and per-version
  name tables are not yet added, so the daemon fails fast at startup rather than
  capturing incorrect data. Support is planned.

### Operational contracts (run under a supervisor)

Two behaviors are by design and must be handled by your service manager:

- **The daemon exits when the postmaster dies.** All resolved addresses
  (load base, `MyProc`/`my_wait_event_info`, per-backend PGPROC slots) are
  specific to one postmaster instance; after a PostgreSQL restart they are
  meaningless, so the daemon exits with the reason
  `PostgreSQL (PID ...) stopped` instead of guessing. Run it under systemd
  so it re-attaches to the new postmaster automatically:

  ```ini
  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pg_wait_tracer --daemon --mode tiered -T /var/lib/pgwt
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=5
  # Watchpoint + bootstrap fds: 2 per backend + headroom (the daemon also
  # raises RLIMIT_NOFILE itself at startup, but the hard limit must allow it)
  LimitNOFILE=4096
  ```

  (`--daemon` already retries discovery in a loop; `Restart=always` covers
  daemon crashes as well.)

- **Same PID namespace as PostgreSQL.** The daemon matches BPF-reported
  kernel PIDs against `/proc` and `postmaster.pid`, which assumes it shares
  the PID namespace with PostgreSQL. Run it on the host for a host
  PostgreSQL. For a containerized PostgreSQL, run the daemon **inside that
  container** (or join its PID namespace, e.g.
  `nsenter -t <postmaster-pid> -p`); running it on the host against a
  container's PostgreSQL will mis-map PIDs.

### File descriptor limits (many backends)

Full/tiered capture holds up to two perf fds per backend. The daemon raises
`RLIMIT_NOFILE` at startup to cover its 1024-backend registry, but it cannot
exceed the hard limit granted to it. If you see
`perf_event_open: ... file descriptor limit reached` in the log (each such
failure also increments `wp_attach_failures_total` on the control socket),
raise the hard limit: `LimitNOFILE=` in the systemd unit or `ulimit -Hn`.
