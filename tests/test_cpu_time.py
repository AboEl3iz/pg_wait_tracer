"""test_cpu_time.py — Verify CPU time dominance for compute-heavy queries.

Two tests:
  1. system_event: CPU event has highest total_ms for pure-compute query
  2. time_model:   CPU Time > sum of all Wait classes

Requires: root, running PostgreSQL 18, pg_wait_tracer built.
Usage: sudo python3 tests/test_cpu_time.py [--pid POSTMASTER_PID]
